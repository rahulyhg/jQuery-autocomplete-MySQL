# jQuery-autocomplete-MySQL
jQuery autocomplete using PHP and MySQL

There are bits and pieces of this available around the web and this is an attempt to display a few complete pages incorporating jQuery autocomplete with a MySQL database. In other examples the autocomplete pulls information from a given list on the same page or locally. This example gets sample names from a database then searches the same database for information associated with the chosen name. The database tables are not anything remotely complicated, thus missing from the example.
